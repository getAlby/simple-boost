# Install

`<simple-boost>` is distributed on npm, so you can install it locally or use it via npm CDNs like unpkg.com.

The most simple installation is just to load it from the CD:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/simple-boost@latest"></script>
```

and then use the `<simple-boost address="..."></simple-boost>` tag as described in the examples.

If you want to load the JS locally you can use the dist file from [GitHub](https://github.com/getAlby/simple-boost/tree/main/dist) or install it via NPM.

## Local Installation

```bash
npm i simple-boost
```

## CDN

npm CDNs like [esm.sh]() can directly serve files that have been published to npm. This works great for standard JavaScript modules that the browser can load natively.


### HTML

```html
<script type="module" src="https://esm.sh/simple-boost@latest"></script>
```

### JavaScript

```html
import {SimpleBoost} from 'https://esm.sh/simple-boost@latest';
```
